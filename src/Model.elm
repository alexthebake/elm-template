-- Inside Model.elm, we contain the actual model for the view state of our program. Note that we generally don't include non-view state inside here, preferring to instead generalize things away from the view where possible. For example, we might have a record with a list of assignments in our Model file, but the assignment type itself would be in a module called Data.Assignment.
